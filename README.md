# Robotic Arm
Utilized Direct Differential Kinematics for robot path generation from point A to B using matrix transformations. Integrated articulation restrictions, including translation and rotation limits. Coordinated multi-articulation motion for precise endpoint reach, while managing the generation and parsing of files for
 reading articulation restrictions and writing articulation movement data..
